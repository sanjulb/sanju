Java is 
	Simple  (Easy to learn)
	Secure (Programs run within the JVM )
	Multithreaded (Write programs that does many things simultaneously)
	Platform independent (Java program can be executed on any kind of machine. Write Once Run Anywhere) 
	High Level (Write code in human understandable format like english words)
	Object Oriented (follows object oriented programming model which helps to break the complex code into objects)
	Distributed 
programming language.

Language -> It is the medium of communication.
Program -> It is a set of instructions for a device to perform some specific task.
Programming Language -> It contains set of grammatical rules or syntax to write a program for instructing machine to perform specific tasks.

High Level (Write code in human understandable format like english words)
Platform independent (Java program can be executed on any kind of machine. Write Once Run Anywhere) 

Setup Development Environment and Validate:
-------------------------------------------
One Time Task
1) Downloading Java
2) Installing Java / Unzip Downloaded File
	C:\Program Files\jdk-15.0.1
		bin
			javac
			java
	JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\jdk-15.0.1

3) Setting Path in Environment Variable
	Open My Computer/ (This PC)
	Right Click on blank space and select Properties
	Click on Advanced System Properties from Left Panel
	It will open System Properties
	Under Advanced Tab Click on Environment Variable Button
	Add/Edit new Environment Variable under User Variables
		Variable Name: PATH
		Variable Value: C:\Program Files\jdk-15.0.1\bin
	Close all opened window by selecting OK.
	

For Application:

4) Write a program
a) Open Some Text Editor
b) Write the program
class Test{
public static void main(String args[]){
System.out.println("Hello Guys, Welcome to my World");
}
}	
		
c) Save the file with the name "Test.java" in D:\CODE\JAVA
	D:\CODE\JAVA -> Workspace
Workspace (Place of your file system where project related files are stored)

5) Compile the program
a) Open Command Prompt
b) Change the location to workspace
	cd /d D:\CODE\JAVA
c) Compile Java Source code using Java compiler
	javac <sourceFileNameWithExt>
	javac Test.java

6) Execute/Run your Application
	java <classFileNameWithoutExt>
	java Test


Setting Path on Command Prompt:
SET PATH="C:\Program Files\jdk-15.0.1\bin"	
	-> Replace existing value with new value

SET PATH=%PATH%;"C:\Program Files\jdk-15.0.1\bin"
	-> Append new value with existing value
